# Number of Study hrs
<p>Prdiciton using Supervised ML.</p>
<p>Predicting the percentage of student based on the number of study hours.</p>
<p>Simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.</p>

# Decision Tree
<p>Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm.</p>
<p>Created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically.</p>
<p>The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingle.</p>
